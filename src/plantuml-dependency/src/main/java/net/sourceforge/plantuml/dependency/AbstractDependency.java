/**
 * The interface which describes a generic abstract dependency, no matter the programming language.
 * A dependency might be a class, an interface or an enumeration but it might not be determined when
 * the abstract dependency is created. It is the underlying {@link DependencyType} which concretely
 * determines its real type, such as class, enum or interface. An {@link AbstractDependency} just
 * mean that an object exists, but it only contains the minimum information we can have on this
 * object at the beginning. All details are described by the underlying {@link DependencyType} when
 * it is a concrete instance.
